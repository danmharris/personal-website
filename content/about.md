Graduating in 2019 with a BSc. in Computer Science from the University of Southampton, I am now based in Bath/Bristol where I currently work for Made Tech.

I've been a full-time Linux user since 2018 and haven't looked back since. My daily driver is Ubuntu LTS (currently 20.04) with GNOME. My dotfiles are
available on [GitHub](https://github.com/danmharris/dotfiles).

I tend to use a lot of Python for personal projects, but I'm also fond of other programming languages such as Go and TypeScript.

For the last few years I've run a homelab which is my testbed for tinkering with new services and technologies. In its current state it is a collection of virtual
machines running under Proxmox and configured using Ansible. Its hosted things from mailservers, my personal cloud, metric collecting & monitoring and manages all
my data.
