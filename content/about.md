I am a Manchester based Senior Software Engineer currently working for [Made Tech](https://www.madetech.com). Before that I lived in Bath working for [Netcraft](https://www.netcraft.com). I have a BSc. in Computer Science from the University of Southampton.

Day-to-day I work with Ruby and TypeScript but have used a variety of other languages for personal projects, including Go, Python and Elixir.

I'm a strong supporter of open source software and have been a full time Linux user since 2018. My current setup is Debian Testing with GNOME. My configurations are available in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/danmharris/dotfiles) repository.

I also run a lot of services locally in a homelab which is also a testbed for new services and technology. It is currently a Kubernetes cluster managed via GitOps (Flux).
The configuration is available in my [homelab](https://github.com/danmharris/homelab) repository.
