Created as part of my final year dissertation at university, this is an implementation of a network which conforms to the proposed Web of Things standards by the Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C).

This was a full scope project containing a literature review, planning, design, implementation, testing and evaluation. A front end was also created to easily interact with the network and perform a variety of actions and read properties from a range of (otherwise incompatible) devices.

This project was demonstrated at the second WoT workshop, hosted in Munich by Siemens ([workshop website](https://www.w3.org/WoT/ws-2019/cfp.html)).
