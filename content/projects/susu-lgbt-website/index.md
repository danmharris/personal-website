I was the technical officer for University of Southampton Students' Union (SUSU) LGBT+ Society during my final year (2018-19). This role mainly focusses around maintaining the society website. During my time in this role I completely rewrote the CSS to make it perform efficiently on desktop and mobile devices as well as upgrading to a newer version of the framework. New features were also added at the request of other committee members.
