This project runs the website you are currently browsing. Initially created in September 2016, it has undergone almost yearly updates changing the style and technologies used. I have used this as a platform to practice my HTML and CSS skills and learn new ones such as static site generators. A goal of the site is to write the template completely from scratch.

The current version is created using Hugo and is deployed automatically using Netlify. Previous versions have used an AWS S3 bucket behind CloudFront, or a Docker container, or managed hosting.
