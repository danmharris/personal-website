This project runs the website you are currently browsing. Initially created in September 2016, it has undergone almost yearly updates changing the style and technologies used. I have used this as a platform to practice my HTML and CSS skills and learn new ones such as static site generators. A goal of the site is to write the template completely from scratch.

The current version is created using Hugo and is deployed automatically to an AWS S3 bucket behind CloudFront.
